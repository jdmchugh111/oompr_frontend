## Description

The Oompr Frontend is built with a focus on delivering a smooth user experience, allowing users to explore expensive, out-of-reach homes as a pastime. Users can search for properties using a city or geolocation, view detailed property information, and save their favorite listings. The **Reality Check** feature further enhances the user experience by offering a comparative analysis of high-end properties against homes that fit within the user's budget, helping users understand the real estate market relative to their financial situation.
